## Welcome!
We are community ecologists with a focus on ecological restoration.  Our goal is to produce “usable” science to improve ecosystem management. We use a combination of long-term data analysis, population modeling and field experiments to this end. Our work spans a variety of systems, including working rangelands, serpentine grasslands, oak woodlands, alpine and rivers.

### About Haley
I am a recent graduate at UO with a B.S. in Environmental Science with a concentration in natural science. I’m originally from the San Francisco Bay Area and I’m excited to return after graduation to pursue a career in environmental research and begin the application process for graduate programs in the field of environmental public health.

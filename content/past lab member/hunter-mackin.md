### About Hunter
I am currently finishing my last term at the University of Oregon with majors in Environmental Science and Economics. I am interested in how dynamics of community ecology will change in the future, and how that might inform management today. After graduation, I plan to continue working in the Hallett Lab to gain further experience before attending graduate school.

### Education
2018 Colorado State University _PhD_ in Ecology  
2013 Colorado State University _MS_ in Ecology  
2010 Bellarmine University _BA_ in Biology  

### Research Interests
My research is driven by curiosity about 1) the biological patterns and processes shaping ecological communities and their functions, and 2) the relationship of communities and their biotic and abiotic drivers to global changes.  

### Recent Awards
2020 USDA NIFA Postdoctoral Fellowship  
2018 National Science Foundation Travel Award   
2017 _Antarctic Science_ International Bursary

### About Calvin
I grew up in Bakersfield, CA and graduated high school in 2010. I was fortunate to have a family that recreated in the Sequoia National Forest and we enjoyed hunting and camping. During my childhood we would go to the same spot every year and over the course of my adolescence, I witnessed it change in many ways. Out of high school, I attended community college and started studying forestry. After a year of classes, I decided that I didn't want to be a forester and I drew my sights for Oregon, where I have worked on a ranch, on a filbert farm, and as a lead staff member at the UO Dining Services. 

I'm currently seeking a dual B.S. in Biology and Environmental Science with minors in Landscape Architecture and Geography. I've been a member of the Ecological Society of America for roughly five years - primarily for access to the journals and news in the field - and have volunteered with the Nature Conservancy since the start of 2018. My favorite pastime activities include backpacking and dispersed camping in the Willamette National Forest. I hope to one day complete research relating to terrestrial systems in the urban setting; specifically, how native/natural plant communities influence heat islands, species niche development, resiliency, socioeconomic/health determinant factors, succession focused applications and climate change mitigation. I hope that one day, places like Bakersfield won't be so nature-less and ecologically dysfunctional; instead, ecological services may help alleviate these and other inner city and suburban pressures.

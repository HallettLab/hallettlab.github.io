### About Calvin
I'm a non-traditional student currently seeking a dual B.S. in Biology and Environmental Science with minors in Landscape Architecture and Geography. I find that I'm a passionate person and am equally so about the environment. I look forward to completing research relating to terrestrial systems in the urban setting; specifically, how native/natural plant communities influence heat islands, species niche development, resiliency, socioeconomic/health determination factors, succession focused applications and climate change mitigation. I hope that one day, urban places won't be so nature-less and ecologically dysfunctional; instead, ecological services may help alleviate these and other inner city, and suburban pressures

### About Drew
I am currently a senior at the University of Oregon pursuing a major in Environmental Studies and minors in Food Studies and Anthropology. I have a passion for Oregon white oak trees in the Willamette Valley that was stimulated by an internship with Friends of Buford Park and Mt. Pisgah. I will continue to work with these oak trees with Hallett Lab by conducting research and writing a thesis on the ecological consequences of pig grazing on the under story vegetation of an oak woodland and an organic filbert orchard. I plan to take this knowledge into a future environmental career and continue to learn more about oak woodlands and savannas.

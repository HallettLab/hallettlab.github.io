### About Elizabeth
I am a current student at the University of Oregon pursuing a double major in Environmental Science and Spanish with a minor in Biology. I have an interest in restoration ecology and am continuing to gain experience through this lab as well as through a potential honors thesis in following years. I am planning to attend graduate school to further my studies and one day create a lasting impact on the ecological world.

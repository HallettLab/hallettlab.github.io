### Education
2020 B.S. in Biology, University of Oregon (expected)

### About Justin
My name is Justin, I’m a senior majoring in Biology with a minor in Environmental Studies. I’m pursuing a masters degree in education and a career in high school education through UO Teach in 2020. I’m fascinated by all realms of biological sciences, and it’s part of my dream to be able to share that with students and inspire them to have the same excitement and curiosity that I have about science! I spent the Summer of 2019 working with the UO’s ESPRIT program and the Hallett lab exploring science research and its importance to science education. Outside of academics, I spend as much time as possible in the outdoors: I love to backpack, bike, mountaineer, surf, climb, and take photos!

### Research Interests
I’m interested in the applications of ecological research in land management and conservation, particularly with respect to global climate change and plant community dynamics. My research is centered around plant communities and their fungal associates in Californian semi-arid rangelands. Particularly, I’m researching the response of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) and plant communities to fertilizer and compost in combination with variations in rainfall.

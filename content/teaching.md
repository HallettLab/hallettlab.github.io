### Intro to environmental science
#### ENVS 202, Winter 2019
Environmental science is the study of natural processes and their modification by human activity. To understand and respond to current environmental problems, we need to understand the dynamics that underlie those problems. As such, environmental science is highly interdisciplinary and draws on ecology, geology, biology, meteorology, chemistry and physics. The aims of this course are to build your capacity to apply science to understand environmental issues and to increase your familiarity with topics in environmental science.

This course is part of the three-term core sequence in Environmental Studies and is required for Environmental Studies, but not Environmental Science majors. It is an introductory course, designed for freshmen and sophomores, and satisfies university general education breadth requirements for natural sciences. ENVS 201, 202, 203 may be taken in any order.


### Data management and visualization
#### BIO 410/ 510, Fall 2018
#### ENVS 410/ 510, Winter 2018
This course covers the non-statistical aspects of the data life cycle, including how to store, clean, visualize and communicate data. It is intended as a complement to statistics courses - we cover how to get your data into shape for analysis, and how to communicate your findings visually. It is primarily a methods class and is taught in R (but there is no expectation that students know R coming in). It fulfills the "Analytical Approaches" requirement for Environmental Studies majors. Course materials are available on [Github](https://github.com/laurenmh/envs-data-course).

### Undergraduate research experience
There are a growing number of opportunities for undergraduates to do research in our group, either in the summer or during the semester. Please contact us if you are interested.

### Data management and visualization
#### BIO 410/ 510, Fall 2018
#### ENVS 410/ 510, Winter 2018
This course covers the non-statistical aspects of the data life cycle, including how to store, clean, visualize and communicate data. It is intended as a complement to statistics courses - we cover how to get your data into shape for analysis, and how to communicate your findings visually. It is primarily a methods class and is taught in R (but there is no expectation that students know R coming in). It fulfills the "Analytical Approaches" requirement for Environmental Studies majors. Course materials are available on [Github](https://github.com/laurenmh/envs-data-course).

### Undergraduate research experience
There are a growing number of opportunities for undergraduates to do research in our group, either in the summer or during the semester. Please contact us if you are interested.

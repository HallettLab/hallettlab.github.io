_Why do populations of the same species often fluctuate in synchrony across space? What causes different species to fluctuate in tandem with one another? How do these forms of synchrony scale to affect ecosystem stability?_

Description of community and population stability

## Community asynchrony increases with climate variability

## Species asynchrony maintains stability in grasslands

## A geography of spatial synchrony in the serpentine

_Why do populations of the same species often fluctuate in synchrony across space? What causes different species to fluctuate in tandem with one another? How do these forms of synchrony scale to affect ecosystem stability?_

Description of community and population stability

## Species asynchrony maintains stability in grasslands
The relationships between environmental variability, species diversity and community stability are highly debated. For example, environmental variability can destabilize species populations through increased stochasticity. However, it can also stabilize species diversity by structuring species tradeoffs (i.e., if different species are favored by different environmental conditions but can persist across unfavorable conditions). Scaling up, species tradeoffs may stabilize community properties (such as primary production) in variable environments if an increase in one species compensates for a decline in another.

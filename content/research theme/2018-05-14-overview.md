We are community ecologists that apply ecological theory to improve ecosystem management and restoration. We are interested in why there are so many species in the world, and what factors shape their abundances over space and time. Our aim is that by understanding ecological dynamics we can better manage ecosystems in a changing world. Please click on the topic headings below for more on each research theme.
